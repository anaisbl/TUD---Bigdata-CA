<h1>Programming with Big Data - Final CA</h1>
<h4>This is the final Continuous Assessment for the class "Programming with Big Data (PROG9813)" in the Data Science for TU059 at TU Dublin.</h4>
The task of the CA is to join a coding competition with a data science aspect and submit our work before it closes.<br>
I have chosen the Kaggle playground series competition for the month of March 2024, with the task of predicting steel-plate defects. The playground series is organized by Kaggle, is open to everyone of any level with Kaggle merchandise to win. It mainly serves the purpose of training for other competitions and improving oneâ€™s knowledge in the machine learning domain.<br><br>
The task of the competition is as follows: to predict the various defects on steel plates using the synthetic dataset provided and any model of your choice. Submissions are evaluated using area under the ROC curve for each of the defect categories and then averaged to give a final score.
